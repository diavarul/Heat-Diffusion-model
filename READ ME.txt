-----------How To run the program-------------

There are some data libraries and softwares which are need to be installed before hand. They are as following:

-NetLogo 6.0.2
-R 3.4.0
-Spyder IDE or PyCharm
-WinPython 3.6.3
-Download and install PypeR and matplotlib library from respective sourceforge or github folders
 
-The file Heat diffusion should be saved in Netlogo in the directory by making a small folder called.
("/models/Sample Models/demo/Heat Diffusion.nlogo")

-The python file heat.py can be saved and called from the root directory where winpython is installed,
Or it can be saved as per user convenience.

Note: If everything is properly setup the netlogo will run by itself, no need to tick any boxes or choose any slider
values

-I have taken a simple procedure of taking only heat diffusivity on the plotting curve.
Hence, It will be showing a plot against thickness of layer and diffusivity while printing out the heat diffusivity
values at different time step on the kernel.
